## semantic-release

Here is the list of commit types that conform to the conventional commits specification and can be used with semantic-release:

`feat`: A new feature
`fix`: A bug fix
`docs`: Documentation changes
`style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing `semi-colons, etc)
`refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
`perf`: A code change that improves performance
`test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
`build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
`ci`: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
`chore`: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
These commit types are widely used and are the default types used by semantic-release if you're using the default commit-analyzer plugin.

For more detail and examples, you can check the following documentation and websites:

[The official documentation of semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/)
[The website of Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

This should give you all the information you need to format your commits correctly and use semantic-release effectively.
